  [33X[0;0YTo  make  GAP and polymake work together porperly, one has to make sure that
  the two systems are using the same GMP library. You can choose the GMP which
  polymake  uses  by  the  flag  --with-gmp= in the polymake configure skript.
  However, having BOTH systems using your systems GMP is HIGHLY recommended.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YHow to install this package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  can  only  be compiled on a system that has the new perpetual
  beta  of  polymake correctly installed, like it is said in the polymake wiki
  itself.  For  more  information  about  this  please  visit www.polymake.org
  ([7Xhttp://www.polymake.org[107X).  For installing this package, first make sure you
  have  polymake  installed.  Copy  it  in  your GAP pkg-directory and run the
  configure script (./configure) with your GAP root-directory as argument. The
  default  is  ../../...  Then run make. After this, the package can be loaded
  via LoadPackage( \"PolymakeInterface\" );.[133X
