    README file for the `PolymakeInterface' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    PolymakeInterface-x.x.tar.gz
    PolymakeInterface-x.x.tar.bz2
    PolymakeInterface-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    tar xvf PolymakeInterface-x.x.tar.gz
respectively
    unzip PolymakeInterface-x.x.zip

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `PolymakeInterface'.

After that open the package folder and compile it by launching the configure ./configure, optional
with the gap root directory as an argument (default is ../..) and compile it by typing make.

This completes the installation of the package.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would be pleased to hear about applications of this package.
