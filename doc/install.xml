<Heading>Installation of the &Gauss; Package</Heading>
<Index>&Gauss;</Index>

To install this package just extract the package's archive file to the
GAP <F>pkg/</F> directory. The &Gauss; package utilizes some C-code by
Max Neunhoeffer that has to be compiled before you can load Gauss. To
compile the code, first run <C>./configure</C>. If the package is not
installed in the <F>gap/pkg/Gauss</F> directory you will need to
provide the correct directory. This will create a makefile. Complete
the installation of the package by running
<C>make</C>. Recompiling the documentation is possible by the command
<C>make doc</C> in the Gauss directory, but this should not be
necessary.<P/>

By default the &Gauss; package is not automatically loaded by &GAP;
when it is installed. You must load the package with
<C>LoadPackage("Gauss");</C> before its functions become
available. Please, send me an e-mail if you have any questions,
remarks, suggestions, etc. concerning &Gauss;. Also, I would like to
hear about applications of this package.<Br/>
