<Heading>Installation of the &homalg; Package</Heading>

To install this package just extract the package's archive file to the
&GAP; <F>pkg</F> directory.<P/>

By default the &homalg; package is not automatically loaded by &GAP;

before its functions become available.<P/>

Please, send me an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks,
suggestions, etc. concerning this package. Also, I would be pleased to
