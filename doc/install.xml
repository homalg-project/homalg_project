<Heading>Installation of the &homalg;-Package</Heading>

To install this  package just extract the package's  archive file to
the  GAP  <F>pkg</F>  directory.<P/>

By default the <Package>homalg</Package> package is not automatically
loaded by &GAP; when it is installed. You must load the package with
<C>LoadPackage("homalg");</C> before its functions become available.<P/>

Please, send us an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks,
suggestions, etc. concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear
about applications of this package.<P/>
