The package &homalg; is meant to be the first volume of a continuously
growing opensource book about <URL Text="homological
algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra</URL>. &homalg;
is an attempt to translate as much as possible of homological algebra,
as can be found in books like <Cite Key="ce"/>, <Cite Key="ML"/>,
<Cite Key="HS"/>, <Cite Key="rot"/>, <Cite Key="weihom"/> and <Cite
Key="GM"/>, into a language that <E>also</E> a computer can directly
understand. Yes, ``also'': &homalg; should, as the above mentioned
books, by a great extent be readable by a human being.  Finding such a
language was by no means an easy task (&see; <Ref
Sect="FirstSteps"/>). For the reasons mentioned below (&see; <Ref
Sect="WhyGAP4"/>) I have chosen &GAP4; as the language of this book
project.
