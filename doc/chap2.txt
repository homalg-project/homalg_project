  To  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [11Xpkg[0m directory.
  
  By  default  the [5XHomalgRings[0m package is not automatically loaded by [5XGAP[0m when
  it  is installed. You must load the package with [10XLoadPackage("HomalgRings");[0m
  before its functions become available.
  
  Please,  send  us an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions,
  etc.  concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear about applications
