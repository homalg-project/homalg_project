    README file for the `homalg' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    homalg-x.x.tar.gz
    homalg-x.x.zoo
    homalg-x.x.tar.bz2
    homalg-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    gunzip homalg-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf homalg-x.x.tar
respectively
    unzoo -x homalg-x.x.zoo
and so on.

(Note that if you use a browser like `netscape' for downloading the
archive file the `gunzip' step above may already be done by the browser,
although the name of your file may still have the misleading `.gz'
extension.)

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `homalg'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Testing the package is possible by invoking

ReadPackage( "homalg", "maketest.g" );

from within GAP.

You also need the package Modules from the homalg project to run the test.
You can download it from:

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
